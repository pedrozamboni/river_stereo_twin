# Water Ponding Analysis with Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation and data for our paper "Measuring water ponding time, location and connectivity on soil surfaces using time-lapse images and deep learning" published in CATENA.

## About

This repository includes:
- Implementation of deep learning models for water ponding analysis
- Dataset of time-lapse images and annotations
- Project webpage
- Supplementary materials

Our work demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks can be used for direct spatial-temporal mapping of water ponds, addressing key challenges in measuring and understanding soil infiltration processes.
