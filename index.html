            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Water level information is essential for monitoring and modelling river systems. Traditional water level monitoring is done using intrusive gauging methods, such as pressure gauges; however, these sensors might be lost during an intense flood. Furthermore, in extreme flood or drought events, measurements may become insufficient.</p>
            
            <p>Camera gauges have gained attention over recent years as a low-cost and remote sensing approach for river monitoring. They provide a more flexible and convenient setup, with cameras installed in a safe location. Moreover, they can efficiently monitor a wide range of water level values and can be used to estimate water surface velocity for river discharge measurement.</p>
            
            <p>In this study, we propose to change the camera gauge paradigm by using two cameras and applying stereo-photogrammetry. Using this approach, points from two images can be projected into a 3D space without the need for a 3D model. The only required additional information besides the interior camera geometry is the distance between the two cameras (baseline).</p>

            </div>
            <p>Our methodology combines both classical and deep learning approaches for stereo reconstruction. The classical approach uses standard matching algorithms (SIFT, SURF) for keypoint matching between images. The deep learning approach employs neural networks for feature matching, achieving more robust results in challenging conditions with low texture or difficult lighting.</p>
